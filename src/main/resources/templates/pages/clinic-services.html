            <h2>PREVENTION - VACCINATIONS</h2>
            <p>We can build protection against various infectious diseases according to a scheme
                with properly selected vaccination preparations. Regular vaccination protects you,
                your pet and others from contagious diseases. Initial vaccinations build a protective
                wall (immunity), and annual revaccinations maintain it at the level necessary to
                protect the body. Make an appointment to review and determine the most appropriate
                vaccination schedule.</p>

            <h2>MICROCHIPS</h2>
            <p>The procedure of placing a chip on your pet should be carried out by a specialist.
                It's a one-time thing and can save you a lot of headaches when your pet runs away,
                gets lost in the park, gets stolen, etc. The chip contains information about your
                pet and about you as the owner, which is easily read by special readers for this
                purpose. If you are still wondering and haven't done it yet, make an appointment
                for a consultation on our phones.</p>
