            <h2>EMERGENCY CASES</h2>
<p>If your pet's condition suddenly worsens, it is good to be prepared and know how to react in the
    event of an emergency. At such times, it is good to know how to make the right first aid
    decision and how to transport your pet safely.</p>
<p>1. Insect sting. Any sting from wasps, bees and other insects, as well as bites from other
    animals and snakes can seriously endanger the life of your friend. Seek help from your
    veterinarian immediately.</p>
<p>2. Bleeding. First, try to stop the bleeding. Use soft material, cotton, preferably sterile.
    Place on the affected area and press lightly with a bandage on top. Then arrange an appointment
    with your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>3. Urgent conditions in which you should immediately seek competent help: copious salivation,
    swelling in the eye area, vomiting, impaired breathing, paralysis of the limbs, refusal of usual
    routine activities.</p>

            <h2>THE DAY BEFORE OPERATION</h2>
            <p>1. The patient should not have access to food for at least 12 hours before anesthesia</p>
            <p>2. The patient should not drink water for at least 2 hours before anesthesia</p>
            <p>3. Before anesthesia, during the walk, the animal should not be allowed to take anything
                outside - grass, leaves, twigs, waste.</p>
            <p>4. Prior to anesthesia, a veterinarian will examine the patient to measure all vital signs.</p>
            <p>5. It is necessary to have up-to-date blood tests done a few days before the operation, proving
                that your pet can be sedated and operated on.</p>
            <p>6. The anesthesia itself consists of several parts, and premedication is initially applied -
                a means that reduces the side effects of anesthesia and improves vital functions. A muscle
                relaxation anesthetic is then applied, followed by a venous catheter through which intravenous
                fluids are infused and intravenous anesthesia is introduced, allowing - intubation - insertion
                of a tracheal tube through which oxygen is supplied and maintenance inhalation anesthesia.</p>
